    <h2>Sect‭ion one</h2>
    <p>
     I am sitting on my balcony. It is spring and there is a little bit of heat in the sun. The balcony looks out over a road. The road is usually busy… an endless stream of trucks and cars but right now there is no traffic. Everyone is self-isolating. The machine has stopped. It feels strange. Peaceful. I can hear different birds… the wren, the blackbird, the robin. A blue tit is flitting from one branch to the next. Life goes on. I could sit here all day.“Don’t try”. Those are the two simple words of advice offered by the poet Charles Bukowski.It jars for most people to receive that advice… especially those of us who want a better world.I have been stuck in a cycle of “trying” for a while now and I see a lot of it in the world.Trying and searching and wanting.Everywhere I look people, including me, are rushing to the next moment.I know that 99% of people probably won’t resonate with what I’m going to say. They might think that I’m an idiot and that this piece is a cop out.Not trying is seen as the “worst”.!

       The absence of a deep emotional connection between humans and the natural world is at the root of the environmental crisis.Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well?Close your eyes for a moment and see what comes up.Can you visualise the place in exquisite detail? The sounds, the colours, the smells, the subtleties that only you know.Do memories surface? Perhaps you have known this place for a long time. Maybe you spent golden moments from your childhood here? There might be happy memories tinged with sadness or regret?How does it feel when you bring this place to mind now?Please don’t rush. Take a moment to connect.Now another question.How would you feel if this same place was under imminent threat? Imagine someone is destroying it right now. What do you feel? Anger? Sadness? Shock? Resignation? Nothing at all?Can you imagine that you might actually do something immediate and tangible to help protect this place?Be honest with yourself.!!

       "Nature is not a place to visit. It is home."– Gary Snyder...In a very real sense, mountains and valleys, the seas and the skies, the sun and the earth, the trees and the flowers constitute our home, our natural habitat.Growing up in the modern developed world we can easily come to believe that towns and cities – the urban and artificial environment – is where we naturally belong. But our brains and bodies, which evolved over thousands of years, were designed by and designed for an environment very different to the one we live in now.Throughout our evolutionary history we lived in very close connection to the land, with a very close kinship with other creatures. Our physiological system evolved to survive in wild, natural environments and developed a love and kinship for these places that lives on in our DNA.This connection with the land combined with the kinship we would have felt with other living things that shared the land as their home has hardwired in us a strong sense of the natural world as ‘home’, and the importance of connection with all of life as being essential to our well-being.!!
